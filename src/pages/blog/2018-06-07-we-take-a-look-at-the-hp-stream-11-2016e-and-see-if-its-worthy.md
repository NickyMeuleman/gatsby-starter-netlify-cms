I get asked a lot on social media what laptop is that or is that a chrome book rest assured it is not a chrome book it is the HP Stream 11 2016E. Now I've had this laptop for some time now and I'm going to share my exp. with it as well as my pitfalls. Lets start with the bad to end on a good note at first the laptop seemed fast and springy even but as time went on it slowed down quite a bit and I don't even have windows on it I have Linux if you want to know how to install Linux we have an article here How to install Linux. And then on top of that the little grip thingy around the screen to keep it propped up from the screen touching the keyboard fall off really easily. The whole laptop is made in plastic and the glue that they use while making it falls off or gets removed easily.</p>

Now lets get into some good news this laptop has 4GB ram, a 32GB SSD, 1 usb 3.0, 1 usb 2.0 ports, as well as 1 HDMI port, 1 MicroSD card slot, and a headphone jack its not going to run the latest and best games out there but if you need to write word doc's, browse the web stream Netflix or Hulu this will be your friend. Now you aren't going to be watching it outside due to it's TN panel but inside its good enough for watching YouTube or Netflix. And that's what I call this thing the good enough laptop even here in 2018 at the time of writing this as this being a 2016E laptop. This hands down is a work or back to school laptop it's cheap enough as well as powerfull enough and the battery last up to 8 hours. Sometimes I can manage a full day with this laptop on a light work day but other days I have to now and then throw in the charger to get more juice. All in all this is worthy enough as a work or back to school laptop even in 2018. its good for Collage students, kids as there first laptop even a family member who doesn't know a lot about tech and just wants to get to work straight away. You can pick this up at Walmart, Target or Amazon for around $215.00 USD.
